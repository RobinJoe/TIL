Web scraping saves time from copy pasting lists of content from websites.
It writes a list of items. Python methods with an lxml library can use 
xpaths on a website to retrive information. This is one of many
solutions to web scraping. Python and Beautiful Soup, or Python and 
Selenium can combine to search a website for content, and store 
that content in a variable to be printed or added to a file.

To test out Web Scraping, I created a script to scrape through 
the Big Finish Eighth Doctor Collection, and Count up the number 
of actors listed in index position [2] on the XML nodes that 
contain the two actors the website uses to describe each 
story (found in the figure caption tag content)

I used the counter library again alongside the lxml and requests
libraries. 

I commented out the extra lines to convert the list generated by the 
scrape into a string since I don't have a plan for a string yet.
