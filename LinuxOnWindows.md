# Linux on Windows

I have been using Linux on Windows. It works, but the experience can be improved with troubleshooting content. For example what to do if you 
start out using Linux Bash on Windows, set up the Sudo account and password, but forget the credentials, and neglect to set up them up in
a password credential handler. 

Users can access a shadow file to adjust User and Root user, and change the password. 

Windows users can locate the shadow file, adjust the user hash string, re-open bash, switch to the sudo user, change the password, and then switch back to the
regular user. 

The instructions I adapted were in the following stack exchange item: https://askubuntu.com/questions/772050/reset-the-password-in-ubuntu-linux-bash-in-windows
