Postman is an api development and testing software. This testing software forms a 
part of API testing toolchains.

### Using Postman to investigate the Marvel devloper API

Current results: not successful

Working on a GET request to the Marvel API server with my API key, an automatically
generated timestamp (ts) variable, and a hash value made from a global variable.

This global variable makes a hash by combining the API key with the time stampe, and 
then processing the combined result with an MD5 algorithm. This encrypts or "hashes"
the apikey and time stamp. 

The proble: establishing this variable in a script with Postman is not working in 
my current set of global variables.
